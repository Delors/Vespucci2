      Vespucci enables you to model a program’s structural dependencies to help you understand, document and communicate an application’s design.

Having an architectural description of a program’s structure has at least two main advantages: First, it facilitates comprehension of the application and it also fosters maintenance and evolution of the application. Second, it enables the assessment of the modularity of an application to identify parts that can easily be reused as is or that are potentially reusable (after some refactorings).
